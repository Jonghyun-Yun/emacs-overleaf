* What is this?
=Emacs-Overleaf= helps you sync a local Overleaf project with its remote.
* Who needs this?
Those who want to use Emacs to edit Overleaf documents in a local machine will be interested. If you pay extra dollars to sync Overleaf projects via Dropbox, this is not a right package for you.
* Motivation
Collaborators use Overleaf to share LaTeX documents. Rather than using an online Overleaf editor, I choose Emacs to edit the documents. To do so, I need to frequently sync an Overleaf project with a local project using =Git=. When I fail to do so, there is a high probability that I waste my time resolving merge conflicts.
* What does this do?
Upon switching to a local project using =projectile=, the local will be synced with the Overleaf project. Upon saving LaTeX or BibTeX buffer, this package can do the following actions depending on a value of its buffer-local variable, =overleaf-auto-sync=
- nil: Occasionally show you a sync reminder;
- "always": Commit and push local changes to Overleaf with auto-generated commit messages;
- "ask": Ask if you want to commit and push local changes to Overleaf with auto-generated commit messages; or
- "never": Do nothing.

* How to use
=config.el= needs either =(require 'emacs-overleaf)= or =(use-package emacs-overleaf :commands (overleaf-setup))=. The project's =origin= =master= should be set as the corresponding Overleaf project. The project's =.dir-local.el= needs to contain =(eval . (overleaf-setup))= as follows:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
((nil . ((eval . (overleaf-setup)))))
#+end_src
Also, add =overleaf-auto-sync= to file-local-variable to determine what action will be performed after saving.
